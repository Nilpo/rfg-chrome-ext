Real Favicon Generator Chrome Extension
=======================================

A simple extension for the Chrome web browser that allows you to quickly and easily create cross-platform and cross-browser favicons using the realfavicongenerator.net generator.

### Caveats

The current implementation will not work for some Mac users due to a known bug.  This appears to have been fixed in Chrome Version 39.0.2171.95 (Mac).  More information can be found in the bug report.
